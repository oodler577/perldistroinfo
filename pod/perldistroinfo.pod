=head1 NAME

perldistinfo - Collection of information about how various avenues of C<perl> track upstream development
for eventual inclusion into their systems.

=head1 Debian

I<RC releases are typically the first time that Debian integrates the new
changes for testing. We upload RCs to the 'experimental' distribution and
use that to perform widespread rebuild testing against the Debian archive.> [1]

L<https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=perl&suite=sid>

=head1 OpenBSD

Includes a specific version of C<perl> with each release:

L<https://man.openbsd.org/perl>

More information on the build and development process as it relates to the included
version of C<perl> is needed.

=head1 FreeBSD

FreeBSD maintains several versions of upstream C<perl> in its ports system. C<perl> was
included in the base OS until version 4.xx (confirm+ref needed).

It disambiguages the varous versions of C<perl> through the use of a symlink C</usr/local/bin/perl>
that points to a I<versioned> binary.
