Please view the open issues and contribute information about
your platform/package system of choice as your inherent knowledge
or time to research permits.

This is a "best effort" and all contributions are appreciated.

Project Goals:

- obtain sufficient coverage in order to provide benefit to upstream
perl porters, developers, and system integrators so that decisions
about upstream perl release processes may be made with as much information
as possible

- eventually provide this document via CPAN, or if deemed worth, into
the base set of core perl docs itself

Contributor Pool:

- users knowledgable about a particular platform or environment

- system package maintainers, themselves

- individuals interested in contributing to a worthy endeavor for the
long term benefit of perl
